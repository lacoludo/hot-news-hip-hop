            <p itemprop="description">Kanye West has reached out to Jay-Z to work out their recent issues, according to a report from TMZ. A source "close to the situation" has suggested that West has requested a "face-to-face" conversation with his longtime friend and collaborator.
              This follows a public feud the two artists have been involved in since Kanye spoke candidly about their strained relationship at a show on the Saint Pablo tour last October. "Don't call me, after the robbery, and say 'how you feelin?' You
              wanna know how I'm feelin? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house," he said. He also directly addressed Beyonce at a November performance: "I was hurt, I went down seven years on behalf of [you]... Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard
              that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling.” Shortly after the comments, Kanye was hospitalized.</p>

            <p itemprop="description">Earlier this week, an alarming report surfaced that the legendary Lil Wayne had suffered several seizures, and had to be hospitalized as a result. Weezy fans immediately feared the worst, as the rapper has epilepsy, and a severe enough seizure
              can be devastating to one’s physical and mental health. Luckily for everyone involved, Wayne bounced back, seemingly stronger than ever. After his manager announced that his work ethic could never be stifled, pictures hit the internet revealing
              that Wayne was already back in the studio, working on new music with Damian Lillard and Scott Storch.</p>
